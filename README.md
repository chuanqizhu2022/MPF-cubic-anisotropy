# MPF-cubic-anisotropy

This is a basic multi-phase-field model that can simulate the growth of grains with cubic anisotropic interface energy.

You can extend this model based on your needs.

Dowdload the code by entering the terminal command in your folder:

```
git clone https://github.com/chuanqizhu2022/MPF-cubic-anisotropy.git
```

Permit the shell script by

```
chmod 755 run.sh
```

Run the program by simply entering:
```
./run.sh
```

The vtk data files in /data/phi can be visualized by Paraview.

Cross-section images of the simulation box can also be quickly checked in the /figures/phi
