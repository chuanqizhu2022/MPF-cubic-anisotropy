# MPF-cubic-anisotropy

This is a basic multi-phase-field model that can simulate the growth of grains with cubic anisotropic interface energy.

You can extend this model based on your needs.

Dowdload the code by enter the terminal command in your folder:

```
git clone https://github.com/chuanqizhu2022/MPF-cubic-anisotropy.git
```

Run the program by simply entering:
```
./run.sh
```

in the terminal

The vtk data files in /data/phi can be visualized by Paraview.

Cross-section images of the simulaitn box can also be quickly checked in the /figures/phi
