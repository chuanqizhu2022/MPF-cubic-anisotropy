# MPF-cubic-anisotropy

This is a basic multi-phase-field model that can simulate the growth of grains with cubic anisotropic interface energy.

You can extend this model based on your needs.

Run the code by typing

./run.sh

in the terminal

The vtk data files in /data/phi can be visualized by Paraview.

Cross-section images of the simulaitn box can also be quickly checked in the /figures/phi
