# MPF-cubic-anisotropy

This a basic multi-phase-field model that can simulate growth of grain with cubic anisotropic energy.

You can extend this model based on your needs.

Run the code by typing

./run.sh

in the terminal

The vtk data files in data/phi can be visulized by paraview.

Cross section images of the simulaitn boxed can also be quickly checked in the figures/phi
